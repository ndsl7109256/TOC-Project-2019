It is the program for the Facebook Chat bot that to search results of local election in Taiwan ,make the referendum easy to read and make a simple opinion poll.
## Why do I want to do this chat bot?
Honesytly,I felt disappointed about the medias in Taiwan.Instead of delivering practical message,they spent most of the time for the meaningless fight between candidates.

What's worse,fallacy about some issues was spreaded widely with community software.

In order to  deny the rumor,I try to do this chat bot,making a wish to make Taiwan better:))
## Simple guide
